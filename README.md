# darkskyglass #

This theme started as a modification to another GTK+2 theme called Modern Glass
Blue, using colors from a bblean theme named darksky by
[ratednc-17](http://www.ratednc-17.com). Unfortunately I can no longer find much
information about the former. In any case, I'm slowly working on porting the
theme to GTK+3.
